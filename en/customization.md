In [Content Management](../content-management), you have already learned about all kinds of content of Eureka. Next, we will introduce Eureka's customization options. Customize Eureka will lead you to understand how Eureka is configured and its options.

<!--more-->

## Navigation Bar

You can define the content of the web page navigation bar simply and quickly. In `config/_default/menus.yaml`, there are multiple `main` modules, just modify them according to the content in the sample file. For example, adding the archive page in the navigation bar only needs to add the following content:

```yaml
main:
  - name: Archive
    url: /archive/
    weight: 40
```

It should be noted that the order of the navigation bar is in ascending order of the size of `weight`.

## Highlight

Eureka uses highlight.js to render code highlighting. If you need to configure highlight.js, you only need to configure the `highlight` in `config/_default/params.yaml`.

**highlight.handler(string)**

The optional value is highlightjs.

**highlight.highlightjs.languages(list)**

Highlight.js will include some common languages by default, and other languages can be configured through this property. See [Available Languages](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release/tree/master/build/languages).

**highlight.highlightjs.style(string)**

Eureka uses the solarized-light style of highlight.js by default, and the style used can be configured through this property. See [Available Styles](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release/tree/master/build/styles).

## Math

Eureka supports the use of KaTeX to render LaTeX mathematical formulas. If you need to configure KaTeX, you only need to configure the `math` in `config/_default/params.yaml`.

**math.handler(string)**

The optional value is katex, leave it blank to disable this feature.

**math.katex(object)**

KaTeX related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [Options · KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/options.html). Since Eureka uses KaTeX's auto-render extension, the `displayMode` property in the link will be ignored.

Eureka also supports independent configuration of whether to render math formula for each page or section. For example, you have a project with the following file structure:

```
content/
├── posts
│   ├── post-1.md
│   ├── post-2.md
│   └── ...
│
└── docs
    ├── doc-1
    │   ├── content-1.md
    │   ├── content-2.md
    |   ├── nested-doc
    │   |   ├── nested-content-1.md
    │   |   ├── nested-content-2.md
    |   |   └── _index.md
    │   └── _index.md
    └── ...
```

You can set the value of the `math` attribute in the Front Matter of the file in any level, which will affect this page or all pages under this section. The priority is Page > Section > Site. For example, if I set `math = fasle` in Front Matter of `nested-doc` and set `math = true` in Front Matter of `nested-content-1.md`, it will make `nested-content-1.md` render math formulas. Formulas in other files under the `nested-doc` folder will not be rendered.

## Comment

Currently Eureka supports three types of comment systems (Disqus, Commento and Valine). To activate the comment system, just modify the content related to `comment` in `config/_default/params.yaml`. Take Disqus as an example, if you need to activate Disqus, you only need to modify the content as follows:

```yaml
comment:
  # Options: disqus and commento.
  platform: disqus
  disqus:
    shortname: <your_shortname>
  commento:
    # If self-hosting, please enter the url (e.g. https://commento.example.com) here. Otherwise leave empty.
    url: ''
```
